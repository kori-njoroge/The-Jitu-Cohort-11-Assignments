        <h3>Q1</h3>
        <p>What is the difference between state and props?</p>

        <h3>Q2</h3>
        <p>With the following code blocks, can you say what will happen in each of these instances?
            <br>
            const c1 = 1; <br> c1 = 3;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or updating a string…
        <br>
        const c2 = “hello”;<br>
        c2 += “world!”;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app.
            And cannot be redeclared.
            <br>In our case c2 += "world" is trying to reassign the value of c2 which is syntactically incorrect as per
            the "const" key word usage
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or reassigning an object…
        <br>
        <br>
        const c3 = {}; <br> c3.name = “Geoff”;<br> c3.someValue = “Sausage”;<br>
        <p class="answer">
            Const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is
            immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
            With an object, this means the object itself can still be altered and that why we are able to add values to
            empty object declared using the const
        </p>
        c3 = {};
        <p class="answer">
            on c3 ={} is trying to reassign and m=not mutataing the values of the object. There will be an error of
            invalid reassigning of a variable.

            <h3>Q3</h3>
            <p>Outline the various stages of the React.js lifecycle.</p>
            <p class="answer">
                <p class="stage">(1.) Mounting</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    This method occurs when component is first added to the Dom. <br>
                    <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                    useEffect(): This hook is used to perform setup logic when the component is first mounted, such as fetching data or adding event listeners.
                </div>
                <p class="stage">(2.) Updating</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    This phase occurs when the component receives new props or its state is updated. <br>
                    <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                    useEffect(): In this stage  useEffect hook can also be used to perform update logic, such as re-fetching data or updating event listeners.
                    This hook also excecutes the code inside when the dependecy array changes.
                </div>
                <p class="stage">(3.) Unmounting</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    This stage occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. <br>
                    <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                    useEffect(): In this stage the useEffect hook is used to perform cleanup logic, such as removing event listeners,changing the state of a dependency array, when the component is unmounted
                    useEffect performs the clean up logic if a clean up function is provided.
