        <h3>Q2</h3>
        <p>With the following code blocks, can you say what will happen in each of these instances?
            <br>
            const c1 = 1; <br> c1 = 3;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or updating a string…
        <br>
        const c2 = “hello”;<br>
        c2 += “world!”;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app.
            And cannot be redeclared.
            <br>In our case c2 += "world" is trying to reassign the value of c2 which is syntactically incorrect as per
            the "const" key word usage
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or reassigning an object…
        <br>
        <br>
        const c3 = {}; <br> c3.name = “Geoff”;<br> c3.someValue = “Sausage”;<br>
        <p class="answer">
            Const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is
            immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
            With an object, this means the object itself can still be altered and that why we are able to add values to
            empty object declared using the const
        </p>
        c3 = {};
        <p class="answer">
            on c3 ={} is trying to reassign and m=not mutataing the values of the object. There will be an error of
            invalid reassigning of a variable.

            <p class="stage">(1.) Mounting</p>
            <div class="answer">
                This method occurs when component is first added to the Dom. <br>
                <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                useEffect(): This hook is used to perform setup logic when the component is first mounted, such as
                fetching data or adding event listeners.

            <p class="stage">(2.) Updating</p>
            <div class="answer">
                This phase occurs when the component receives new props or its state is updated. <br>
                <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                useEffect(): In this stage useEffect hook can also be used to perform update logic, such as re-fetching
                data or updating event listeners.
                This hook also excecutes the code inside when the dependecy array changes.
            </div>
            <p class="stage">(3.) Unmounting</p>
            <div class="answer">
                This stage occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. <br>
                <i>Method called:</i> <br>
                useEffect(): In this stage the useEffect hook is used to perform cleanup logic, such as removing event
                listeners,changing the state of a dependency array, when the component is unmounted
                useEffect performs the clean up logic if a clean up function is provided.

            <h3>Q4</h3>
            <p>Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components</p>
            <p class="answer">
                In React, a "controlled component" is a form element that is controlled by React state, while an
                "uncontrolled component" is a form element that is controlled by its own internal state. <br>
                <br>
                <i>Controlled Component:</i> <br>
                In a controlled component, the value of the form element is set by React state, and any updates to the
                input are reflected in the state. This means that the state is the source the form data, and the form
                elements are updated whenever the state changes.
                <br> To create a controlled component, you would use <b>onChange</b> handlers to update the state
                whenever the form element's value changes, and set the value property of the form element to the value
                stored in the state.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Uncontrolled components</i> <br>
                In an uncontrolled component, the form element manages its own internal state and the React state is not
                updated when the form element changes. <br>
                To create an uncontrolled component, you would omit the value and onChange properties on the form element.
