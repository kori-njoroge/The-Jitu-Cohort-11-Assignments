        <h3>Q1</h3>
        <p>What is the difference between state and props?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <i>State</i> <br>
            state is a way to store and manage local state within a component(the status of a component at a given time). State can be modified by the component, and changes to state trigger re-renders of the component. The state is declared and initialized within the component's class constructor or using the useState hook in case of functional components. <br><br>
            <i>functional components</i> <br>
            const[count, setCount] = useState(0);
            <br>
            The "setCount" is the method that update the state called count.
            State can also be passed as a prop.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="answer">
            <i>Props</i> <br>
            props are short form of properties, they are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only, meaning that the child component cannot modify the props it receives. Props are passed down to a component using the component's tag. <br>
            i.e;
            < Count value ={count} />
            The Count is an imported component to a parent component. <br><br>
            <i>Receiving the passed props</i><br>
            export default function Count(props){
                console.log(props.value).// log the value  which is the count.
            }
        </p>

        <h3>Q2</h3>
        <p>With the following code blocks, can you say what will happen in each of these instances?
            <br>
            const c1 = 1; <br> c1 = 3;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or updating a string…
        <br>
        const c2 = “hello”;<br>
        c2 += “world!”;
        <p class="answer">
            "Invalid assignment to a const variable" <br> a variable declared using the "const" key word cannot be
            reassigned and remains as declared through out the life time of the app.
            And cannot be redeclared.
            <br>In our case c2 += "world" is trying to reassign the value of c2 which is syntactically incorrect as per
            the "const" key word usage
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or reassigning an object…
        <br>
        <br>
        const c3 = {}; <br> c3.name = “Geoff”;<br> c3.someValue = “Sausage”;<br>
        <p class="answer">
            Const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is
            immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
            With an object, this means the object itself can still be altered and that why we are able to add values to
            empty object declared using the const
        </p>
        c3 = {};
        <p class="answer">
            on c3 ={} is trying to reassign and m=not mutataing the values of the object. There will be an error of
            invalid reassigning of a variable.

                This hook also excecutes the code inside when the dependecy array changes.

                listeners,changing the state of a dependency array, when the component is unmounted
                useEffect performs the clean up logic if a clean up function is provided.

            <h3>Q4</h3>
            <p>Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components</p>
            <p class="answer">
                In React, a "controlled component" is a form element that is controlled by React state, while an
                "uncontrolled component" is a form element that is controlled by its own internal state. <br>
                <br>
                <i>Controlled Component:</i> <br>
                In a controlled component, the value of the form element is set by React state, and any updates to the
                input are reflected in the state. This means that the state is the source the form data, and the form
                elements are updated whenever the state changes.
                <br> To create a controlled component, you would use <b>onChange</b> handlers to update the state
                whenever the form element's value changes, and set the value property of the form element to the value
                stored in the state.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Uncontrolled components</i> <br>
                In an uncontrolled component, the form element manages its own internal state and the React state is not
                updated when the form element changes. <br>
                To create an uncontrolled component, you would omit the value and onChange properties on the form
                element.

            <h3>Q5</h3>
            <p>Explain what three dots mean in react</p>
            <p class="answer">
                Known as the "spread operator" is the spread syntax in JavaScript.
                <br> The spread operator allows you to spread an array or an object into
                another array or object.
                In React, it's often used to pass down properties from a parent component to a child component.
                Also used with arrays to spread the elements of one array into another. <br> 
                i.e; <br>
                let Arr1 = [1,2,3,4]; <br>
                let arr2 =[5,6,7,8]; <br>
                let arr3 =[...arr1, ...arr2]// the array 3 contains the elemnts from arr1 and arr2 respectively;
            </p>
